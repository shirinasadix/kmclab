## Gif S1

Representative 1000-step lattice KMC trajectory for Ag₁ diffusion on stoichiometric anatase TiO₂(101) at 300 K. Fifteen Ag monomers (0.15 ML) are randomly initialized on a 10×10 hexagonal lattice. 
Left panel: instantaneous adatom position on the lattice.
Right panel: cumulative mean-squared displacement (MSD) vs time.

The trajectory exhibits pronounced anisotropic diffusion along the [010] (north–south) direction, reflecting lower hopping barriers along rows of twofold-coordinated surface oxygen atoms. 


## Gif S2

Representative 1000-step lattice KMC trajectory for Ag₁ diffusion on reduced anatase TiO₂(101) at 300 K. The system is initialized with 6 oxygen vacancies and 15 Ag adatoms (0.15 ML) randomly distributed on a 10×10 hexagonal lattice.
Left panel: instantaneous Ag position (blue) and oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites (gray rectangular).
Right panel: cumulative mean-squared displacement (MSD) vs time.

Vacancy sites locally perturb diffusion pathways, modifying mobility relative to the stoichiometric surface.


## Gif S3

Representative 1000-step lattice KMC trajectory for Ag₁ diffusion on reduced rutile TiO₂(110) at 300 K. The system is initialized with 7 oxygen vacancies and 15 Ag adatoms (0.15 ML) randomly distributed on a 10×10 square lattice.
Left panel: instantaneous Ag position (blue) and oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites (gray rectangular).
Right panel: cumulative mean-squared displacement (MSD) vs time.

Vacancy sites locally perturb diffusion pathways, modifying mobility relative to the stoichiometric surface.

## Gif S3

Representative lattice-based KMC trajectory (1000 steps) for Ag₁ diffusion on hydroxylated anatase TiO₂(101) modeled using a hexagonal lattice at 300 K. The simulation is initialized with 15 Ag adatoms and 10 OH species randomly distributed on a 10 × 10 lattice, corresponding to surface coverages of 0.15 ML (Ag) and 0.10 ML (OH). To reflect the substantially higher mobility of surface hydroxyls relative to Ag, OH species are redistributed at each KMC step.
The left panel displays the instantaneous lattice configuration, while the right panel shows the cumulative mean-squared displacement (MSD) of Ag as a function of simulation time.
